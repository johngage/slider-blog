# First build: 28 March 2020

- On first download, in /assets: no media directory, so no place to put images for slider.  /assets/images is there. For test, populate three directories with unique images.
  - /assets/media--the future standard location, but not created in this Wowchemy build from template.
  - /assets/images--the old standard location
  - /static/media--the older standard location
- Don't know where the actual shortcode file resides.  Is it pulled from the Wowchemy Github site when slider is invoked? 
- Inserted Thomas Biering's Hugo shortcode for carousel-slider functionality.  Can change line 89 from /static/ to /assets/;  sometimes works

Inserted example of Hugo shortcode written by tbiering: https://github.com/tbiering/hugo-slider-shortcode in /layouts/partials/widgets/tbiering-slider.html
